# Wither Config

Wither Config allows you to adjust the Wither's stats and behavior for a tailored boss experience.

This also fixes a Minecraft bug where the Wither overshoots the distance between it, and its target making it always go towards its target instead of stopping nine blocks away.

This mod was commissioned for the [Trepidation modpack](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/trepidation) by [CalaMariGold](https://www.curseforge.com/members/calamarigold/projects).

Available Configs:
- The Wither health
- The Wither movement speed
- The Wither follow range
- The Wither armor
- The Wither follow distance
- The Wither unarmored fly height
- The Wither summoning sequence length
- The Wither summoning sequence end explosion strength
- Whether the Wither should attempt to break blocks around it when targeting a player
- The Wither ability to break fluids
- The Wither skulls damage
- The Wither skulls magic damage
- The Wither skulls heal towards the Wither when getting a kill
- The Wither skulls explosion strength
- The Wither skulls potion effects
- The boat jail fix
- The boat jail fix tick delay
